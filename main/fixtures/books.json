      "description": "andrew \"ender\" wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. the result of genetic experimentation, ender may be the military genius earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. the only way to find out is to throw ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. ender wiggin is six years old when it begins. he will grow up fast.but ender is not the only result of the experiment. the war with the buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. ender's two older siblings, peter and valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. while peter was too uncontrollably violent, valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. but they are driven by their jealousy of ender, and by their inbred drive for power. peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of earth-an earth that has no future at all if their brother ender fails.source: hatrack.com",

      "description": "sing to me of the man, muse, the man of twists and turnsdriven time and again off course, once he had plunderedthe hallowed heights of troy.so begins robert fagles' magnificent translation of the odyssey, which jasper griffin in the new york times review of books hails as \"a distinguished achievement.\"if the iliad is the world's greatest war epic, then the odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of everyman's journey though life. odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to ithaca after the trojan war, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. in the myths and legends that are retold here, fagles has captured the energy and poetry of homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.renowned classicist bernard knox's superb introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of fagles' translation.this is an odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of homer's students.--robert fagles, winner of the pen/ralph manheim medal for translation and a 1996 academy award in literature from the american academy of arts and letters, presents us with homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.",

      "description": "on november 15, 1959, in the small town of holcomb, kansas, four members of the clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. there was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. as truman capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. at the center of his study are the amoral young killers perry smith and dick hickcock, who, vividly drawn by capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. in cold blood is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.",
